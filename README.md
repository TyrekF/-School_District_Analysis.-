#Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of the School district analysis was to investigate the districts standardize test results. The research would provide insight on performance trends and testing patterns. The insight are used in district meeting to determine where the school board should allocate funds, resources, etc.  The school board also wanted to find evidence of any dishonesty in the results for Thomas High School.


#How is the district summary affected?
•	When we compare the two there is a slight difference in the results. When we removed Thomas High Schools  9th graders Math and Reading scores from the District Summary There was a decrease in the Average math score. The most significance difference showed in the overall passing percentage, passing math percentage and reading percentage.  

#How is the school summary affected?
•	When we removed the Thomas High School ninth graders the school performance number increase dramatically. 
                  % Passing Math   % Passing Reading     % Overall Passing      
Thomas High School	 	66.911315 	    69.663609             65.076453
Thomas High School		93.185690	      97.000000	            92.844974

#How does replacing the ninth graders math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools? 
•	When we replaced Thomas High School ninth graders math and reading scores it placed Thomas High School in the top five schools as opposed to previously being the bottom five.

#How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

#Scores by school spending
•	The number of students decreased from 1,635 to 1,174. The spending per student increased by nearly $250 dollars. 

#Scores by school size
•	The scores by school size was slightly affected.


Once we updated the School District Analysis we noticed four changes to the passing percentage of the math and reading scores. The Overall Passing percentage and the funding for each student changed when we remove the Thomas High School ninth grade students. The spending per student increased as well when we removed the ninth grade. The removal of the ninth grade didn’t really provide whether Thomas High School was being dishonest about their original testing patterns and performance.
